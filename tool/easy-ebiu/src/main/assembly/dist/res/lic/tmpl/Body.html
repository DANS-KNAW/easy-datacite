<p>This Licence Agreement is subject to the following provisions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;<p>


<p><strong>1. Licence</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Depositor grants the Repository a
        non-exclusive licence for digital data files, hereafter
        referred to as 'dataset'.
    </li>
    <li>The Repository is authorised to include the
        dataset in its data archive. The Repository shall transfer
        the content of the dataset to an available carrier, through
        any method and in any form.
    </li>
    <li>The Repository is authorised to make the dataset
        (or substantial parts thereof) available to third parties by
        means of on-line transmission. In addition, the Repository

        otherwise, to make a copy of the dataset or to grant third
        parties permission to download a copy.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>


<p><strong>2. The Depositor</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Depositor declares that he is a holder of rights to the

        the Databases act (<em>Databankenwet</em>)
        and where relevant the Copyright Act (<em>Auteurswet</em>)
        or otherwise, and/or is entitled to act in the present
        matter with the permission of other parties that hold rights.
    </li>
    <li>The Depositor indemnifies the Repository against
        all claims made by other parties against the Repository with
        regard to the dataset, the transfer of the dataset, and the
        form and/or content of the dataset.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>


<p><strong>3. The Repository</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Repository shall ensure, to the best of its
        ability and resources, that the deposited dataset is archived
        in a sustainable manner and remains legible and accessible.
    </li>
    <li>The Repository shall, as far as possible,
        preserve the dataset unchanged in its original software
        format, taking account of current technology and the costs of
        implementation. The Repository has the right to modify the
        format and/or functionality of the dataset if this is
        necessary in order to facilitate the digital sustainability,
        distribution or re-use of the dataset.
    </li>
    <li>If the access categories "Restricted Access" or
        "Other Access", as specified at the end of this Agreement,
        are selected, the Repository shall, to the best of its
        ability and resources, ensure that effective technical and
        other measures are in place to prevent unauthorised third
        parties from gaining access to and/or consulting the dataset
        or substantial parts thereof.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>


<p><strong>4. The dataset</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">

        specified in the appendix to this Agreement. The appendix
        forms an integral part of this Agreement.
	</li>
    <li>The Depositor declares that the dataset
        corresponds to the specification provided.

        all claims by third parties relating to the content of the
        dataset.
	</li>
    <li>The Depositor will supply the dataset by means of
        a method and medium deemed acceptable by the Repository.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<p><strong>5. Removal of datasets / changes to access conditions </strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Repository may decide not to make the dataset available to third parties
        for a temporary period or permanently as well as to remove the dataset
        from the archive wholly or in part.
        The Repository is entitled to do so if a Depositor has submitted a request
        stating the reasons for this action.
        In the case of not making the dataset available,
        the Repository shall retain the dataset in the data archive,
        but shall no longer allow third parties to access the dataset
        or substantial parts thereof.
    </li>
    <li>If sufficient weighty grounds exist, the
        Repository has the right to remove the dataset from the
        archive wholly or in part, or to restrict or prevent access
        to the dataset on a temporary or permanent basis. The
        Repository shall inform the Depositor in such cases.

<p><strong>6. Availability to third parties:</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Repository shall make the dataset available to third parties
        in accordance with the access conditions agreed with the Depositor:
        "Open Access”, “Open Access for Registered Users”, “Restricted Access”
        or “Other Access”. Access conditions may vary between parts of the dataset.
    </li>
    <li>The Repository shall make the dataset available to third parties
        with whom they have reached agreement on the General Conditions for Use
        only if agreement has been reached with the Depositor on one of the following
        access categories: “Open Access for Registered Users”, “Restricted Access”
        or “Other Access”. Unless agreed otherwise with the Depositor,
        the use of datasets is subject to the General Conditions of Use
        laid down by the Repository. When the “Open Access” access category is agreed,
        the dataset shall be made available to third parties without the Depositor
        necessarily agreeing on the General Conditions for Use with said third parties.
    </li>
    <li>If the access category "Restricted Access" has been agreed,
        the Repository shall make the dataset (or parts thereof) available
        only to the persons and/or organisations specified by the Depositor.
    </li>
    <li>If a dataset (or parts thereof) to which the access categories
        “Restricted Access” or "Other Access" apply contain,
        as evidenced by the specification provided by the Depositor,
        personal data as referred to in the Personal Data Protection Act
        of The Netherlands (WBP; <em>Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens</em>,
        Act of 6 July 2000, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 302,
        Article 9 paragraph 3 and Article 23 paragraph 2),
        the Repository shall make the dataset (or parts thereof) available
        only if this is permitted by law, which in any case should be taken
        to include making the dataset (or parts thereof) available for
        the purpose of historical, statistical or scientific research.
    </li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the above, the
        Repository can make the dataset (or substantial parts
        thereof) available to third parties:
        <ul>

                legislation or regulations, a court decision, or by a
                regulatory or other institution
            </li>
            <li>if this is necessary for the preservation of
                the dataset and/or the data archive
            </li>
            <li>(to a similar institution) if the Repository
                ceases to exist and/or its activities in the field of

        filled in with this dataset as standard under the tab “Description” in EASY.
    </li>
    <li>The general information about the research and the metadata
        relating to the dataset, as defined in article 6.f,
        shall be included in the Repository’s databases and publications
        that are freely accessible to all persons.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>


<p><strong>7. Provisions relating to use by third parties</strong></p>
<ol type="a" indent="15">
    <li>The Repository shall require third parties to whom the dataset
        (or substantial parts thereof) is made available to include in
        the research results a clear reference to the dataset from which data
        have been used. The reference must comply with the
        DANS General Conditions of Use. This obligation does not apply if
        the “Open Access” access category has been agreed on. In that case,
        the Repository will make every effort to inform third parties that
        they should include in their research results in whatever form,
